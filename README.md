# Comboser
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the (absurdly) cool repository of combination.

![comboser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/im-coder-lg/comboser/main/preview%20of%20comboser.png)

**Note**: It is worth noting that this repository is:

1. a work in progress(some bugs here and there)
2. <s>Mac OS and </s>Linux support not out yet(but will be :wink:)
3. Use at your own risk.

If you are ready, this repository is a cursor combination of Mac OS Big Sur, KDE Breeze and Android Material Cursors(blue in color) and they are only for Windows. I am sorry, but I will figure out a method to make it available to <s>macOS and </s>Linux. Till then, if you wanna test this, you can download this repo and go to any of the folders, right-click on the `.inf` file and hitting `Install`. Only for Windows but I will figure it out.

**Note**: I can't add the cursors to macOS(hence the strikethrough) because macOS is closed-source. Nobody should meddle with macOS or any OS in the Apple ecosystem. So, I can't add this to macOS. But the present cursors are perfect. I mean, they are simple, soft, and cute. So I will add the guides only for Windows and Linux. I'm sorry.
